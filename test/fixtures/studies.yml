    This is a cohort study aiming to register all the incident cases of childhood leukaemia diagnosed in Greece. In the absence of an official cancer registry in Greece, all six-childhood haematology-oncology departments in the country have established a national network, entitiled Nationwide Registration for Childhood Haematological Malignancies (NaReCHeM), which is coordinated by the Athens University Medical School. Since 1996, NaReCHeM has been collecting nationwide data regarding children diagnosed with either leukaemia or lymphoma. All six paediatric haematology-oncology departments contribute all new incident cases by filling in a questionnaire and contributing whole blood and serum samples.
    
    The main objectives of the study are the registration of all childhood (0-14 years old) leukemia and lymphoma cases diagnosed and treated in Greece as well as the series of the matched controls that would allow us to conduct epidemiological reserach studies aiming to identify factors such as demographic, socioeconomic, physiological, health information, medical history, or biological (various hormones, genes, polymorphisms, etc.) possibly related to these diseases.

    The Childhood Cancer Research Group (CCRG) maintains and expands with every new year of childhood cancer registrations by the National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) its ability to conduct birth registration record based case-control studies of leukaemia risk, using population-based cases and matched controls covering England, Wales, and Scotland (i.e. Britain). About one-third are leukaemias.
    
    Control birth registration details are selected from birth registers and are matched very closely to cases on sex (male/female), date of birth (forwards or backwards within six months of birth registration) and registration subdistrict in which the birth was registered. For more recently diagnosed cases we have selected two matched controls.
